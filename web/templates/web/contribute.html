    <p><a href="/">Open Education Week</a> is an annual celebration of the people and activities that apply <strong>open practices</strong> to education around the world.</p>

    <p>Every year since 2012, events, activities, and challenges are held at schools, colleges, universities, libraries, and organisations by communities of teachers, librarians, students, policymakers, technologists, activists and enthusiasts. They spend one week in early March sharing, discussing and celebrating their contributions to Open Education, and encouraging more engagement and creation.</p>

    <p>This <a href="/about/">Open Education Week 2023</a> (March 6-10) you can show the world how we are making a difference to education.</p>

    <p>There are two ways to contribute to OE Week 2023. You can contribute by sharing the details of the <strong>Activities</strong> you are hosting during Open Education Week and you can contribute by sharing the <strong>Open Assets</strong> or resources you have created (this automatically adds them to the <strong>OE Week Library</strong>).</p>

    <h2>What are Activities?</h2>
    <strong>Activities</strong> are scheduled sessions, activities, or events (in-person or online). Examples include, but are not limited to, introductions, presentations, panel discussions, workshops, demonstrations, contest, drives, training, or performances. There are no limits! We welcome any format that is creative â€“ as long as it promotes participation and increases awareness of Open Education during the week.</p>

    <h2>What are Open Assets?</h2>
    <strong>Open Assets are</strong> the tangible education-focused resources and products that are created, developed and used by open education initiatives. Open Assets are produced, curated, and distributed in ways that make them freely accessible, usable, and improvable by others, wherever they are. Open Assets may be OERs (Open Educational Resources), Open Textbooks, Open Courses, Open Repositories or Libraries, Open Tools, open technology platforms, etc.</p>
