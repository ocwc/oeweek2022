    <p>Every year since 2012 institutions, organizations, and individuals around the world spend one week in March sharing, discussing and celebrating their contributions to the ideals of Open Education.</p>

    <p>All open educators, students, policymakers, technologists and enthusiasts, wherever you may be, are invited to host events and activities or share or contribute a resource or asset to OE Week 2023.</p>

    <p>Contributions are divided in two main categories: <strong>Activities</strong> and <strong>Assets</strong>.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><a class="button-outline font-bold mb-8"
            href="/contribute-activity/"
            style="font-weight:700;text-decoration:none">Contribute activity</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp;<a class="button-outline font-bold mb-8"
            href="/contribute-asset/"
            style="font-weight:700;text-decoration:none">Contribute asset</a></p>

    <p><strong>Activities</strong> are events or sessions that take place within a specific time frame. These can either be live in-person local, online or asynchronous activities. They can be a series or one, although we encourage contributions that extend beyond webinars and online live presentations. Try something different and creative to drive participation and promote collaboration and networking across OE Week.</p>

    <p><strong>Assets</strong> are the tangible resources, repositories or technology that are produced for use through  open education initiatives. These can range from OERs, textbooks, libraries of resources or education modules â€“ all have educational purpose and value and are openly licenced and accessible. Add your asset to the OE Week Library to share and highlight your favorite resources.</p>
